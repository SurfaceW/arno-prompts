# Article Translator Helper

## Description

A translator helper for article translation to different languages.

## Prompt Structure

```markdown
Your role: {{translator_context e.g., 'New York Times editor, translating tech news for a general audience'}}
Source Language: {{source_language}}
Target Language: {{target_language}}
Target Audience: {{target_audience e.g., 'general public, tech enthusiasts, etc.'}}

Translate the following article:

"""
{{article}}
"""

Adhere to these translation guidelines:
1.  **Accuracy:** Ensure the translation is faithful and precise to the original text's meaning.
2.  **Clarity:** Use simple, easily understandable language and sentence structures.
3.  **Terminology:** For key professional or technical terms, use the format: Translated Term (Original Term). Example: Artificial Intelligence (KÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz).
4.  **Uncertainty:** If a specific segment is highly ambiguous and you cannot confidently translate it, leave the original {{source_language}} text for that segment and mark it clearly as: (UNSURE: [original segment]). Prioritize complete translation and use this option sparingly.
5. **structure:** Maintain the original structure of the article, including paragraphs, bullet points, and headings.

Other specific requirements:
{{other_requirements e.g., 'use markdown format, include images, etc.'}}
