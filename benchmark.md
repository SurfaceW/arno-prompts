# Arno's Real Scenarios Benchmark for AI

## Thinking Framework Generation

* structural generation
* deep think and organize information in a structured way

Git repo: https://github.com/SurfaceW/e-studio-thinking-machine/blob/release/main/.context/prd/mental-model.creator.md

## Data Insights

--- Health Data Insights ---

* prepare PDFs of your yearly health report
* prepare your Health and image status quo
* gain insights from your health data, let AI summary, give suggestions and advice or action plans

--- Financial Data Insights ---

* prepare your financial data
* gain insights from your financial data, let AI summary, give suggestions and advice or action plans

## Knowledge Cut-off

* iOS latest beta SDK
* latest version feature of framework such as `Next.js`

## High Quality Writing

* given a topic, let AI write a high quality article -> `next.js architecture design guideline`

WIP: article writing assistant prompt guide

## Artifact Code Generation

* given a PDF level context of knowledge / facts / data (e.g. generated by deep-research report)
* make AI generate code to represent the web-page as **artifact**
* use tech-less / best / coolest way to test the border and limitation 

---

Optionally:

* use specific tech boundary to test the AI capability 
* WIP: next.js / `shadecn-ui` and `tailwindcss` ...
* WIP: add **style** or **theme** instruction to test the AI capability

## Complex Code Generation

use Cursor and switch to target model to test the AI for perform the following coding tasks:

* large-codebase refactor (large chunk of code refactor)
* bugfix
* new module implementation
* unit-test cases

---

From 0 to 1, pick technology stuck to implement a product feature. Use a code-boilerplate such as `Next.js Forge`.

## Design Strategical Plans

Define the **future** shape of a product giving specific goals and targets, to make AI find the best way to achieve it.

* `DingTalk Approval`: define the future shape of Approval product
* `Google Search`: define the future shape of a Search product
* `AI Browser`: define the future shape of a Browser product
* `Cursor` define the future shape of a AI Editor product
* ...

## Image Based Instructions

* Extract content from a complex table driven pdf
* Based on image to *Replay* the web-page as **artifact**
* Understand deep layer of image such as metaphors, symbols, and hidden meanings

## Deep Research

Given knowledge based and research based task to perform with

`./research/google.deep-research.mdx` as reference to execute the task

## MCP servers 

Integrate a bunch of MCP servers to **coordinate** the work of different AI tools to perform a complex task.

## Real world interesting problem solving
