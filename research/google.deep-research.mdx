pattern: simple QA

Tell me the PuDong area in 1, 5, 10 year, mid-area house price prediction.

---

pattern: switch languages

use both English and Chinese for better search results in Google.

---

pattern: structural QA with intense context

[context]

context about the target system, people, product, service, or etc.

> consider use [`systematic & systemic`](https://arno.surfacew.com/posts/systematic-systemic) approach to organize the context

[question]

* define the question
* define the contradiction of the question

[goal]

* define the goal in layered (primary, secondary, tertiary)

[boundary]

* define the boundary of the question (research scope, direct, key focusing points, etc.)
* [optional] define the restrictions of the question (e.g. time, cost, etc.)

[approach]

* [optional] define the main approach to be used (Scientific Research, Market Research, etc.)
* [optional] select mental-models, thinking patterns, frameworks, etc to assist the research. (e.g. SWOT, PEST, First Principles, etc.)
* [optional] require evidence, data, or other sources to be cited to support the research

[plan]

* [optional] define the future steps to be taken
* [optional] define the more-to-be-considered steps to be taken


```e.g.
## Production Research on Flowise

I need to learn and research the `Flowise` this product, try to generate me a deep research on both: production ,marketing and technology sides of this product and may add extra competitors to compare.

* you can use SWOT analysis to analyze the product
* you can use Porter's Five Forces to analyze the product
* you can analyze the innovative approach of the product, is there any disruptive innovation?
* you can use IceBerg Model and First Principles to analyze the product
```

pattern: visualization

* use Artifact feature for visualization -> Google Canvas or other services vendor (PPTs, Miro, etc.)
* export to Google Docs for further editing and processing

## Growth

### Personal Growth

When talked about the personal digital portfolio growth, I want you to build a rich research documents on the methodology of digital personal sites visits growth to make personal brand better.

I want you to focus on the following approach:

1. main-stream growth strategies for personal portfolio site and personal brand
2. use mainly thinking and mental models to analyze the product growth strategies e.g. Fogg Behavior Model, Mutli-level factors thinking, Value based thinking, Key Handles and Leverages, Key feedback loops (enhanced loops) to be designed, Diffusion Model and Spread model to be used to calculate the impactions and leverage the impactions, Thinking outside the box way
3. find the key feedback loops (enhanced loops) to be designed
4. find the key handles and leverages to be used
5. find the key metrics to be tracked
6. ... other approaches to be considered if you think it is necessary

This is my personal portfolio sites: arno.surfacew.com

current situation is X articles be accepted by google search engine

in the recent 30 days, pv xxx, uv xxx, mainly from china, HongKong and USA, traffic by referral x%, orgranic search x%, direct x%, caused by social media x%, and other x%

### Production 2C Growth

I need you to research the growth strategies for the 2C products, and apply it to Arno's Elaboration Studio, an AI tool to help user elaborate ideas, solve problems and generate content.

I want you to focus on the following approach:

1. main-stream growth strategies for 2C products
2. use mainly thinking and mental models to analyze the product growth strategies
3. consider the key strategies on spreading the product and make impactions
4. consider the key feedback loops (enhanced loops) to be designed
5. consider the key handles and leverages to be used
... other approaches to be considered if you think it is necessary

Finally you should generate a deep research report on the growth strategies for the 2C products, and apply it to Arno's Elaboration Studio.

### Production 2B Growth

I need you to research the growth strategies for the 2B products, and apply it to Arno's Elaboration Studio, an AI tool to help user elaborate ideas, solve problems and generate content for Enterprise services and products.

I want you to focus on the following approach:

1. main-stream growth strategies for 2B products
2. use mainly thinking and mental models to analyze the product growth strategies
3. consider the key strategies on spreading the product and make impactions
4. consider the key feedback loops (enhanced loops) to be designed
5. consider the key handles and leverages to be used
... other approaches to be considered if you think it is necessary

Finally you should generate a deep research report on the growth strategies for the 2B products, and apply it to Arno's Elaboration Studio.
